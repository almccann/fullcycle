# Running Full Cycle remotely

Normally, the Full Cycle controller will be installed locally, on the same subnetwork as the miners behind a firewall. In other words, Full Cycle will scan the local subnet 192.168.*.* and communicate with the miners locally. In this configuration the miners will be managed through the Full Cycle React web site.  

In rare cases you may wish to run the controller remotely from the miners. In this case you will use VPN software to connect to the network where the miners are.
